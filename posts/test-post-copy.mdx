Yes, Yes, without the oops! Just my luck, no ice. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking.

God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Life finds a way. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.
