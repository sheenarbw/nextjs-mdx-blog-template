blurb: "This post covers the tech stack used in this website. It covers how to configure mdx, the component library in use and even hosting. This is a technical article that will get you set up to do something similar"

In a [previous article](/posts/how-i-chose-next-as-a-blog-tool) I
spoke about why I chose to use Next.js for this blog. If you are interested in how we got here then go read that first. It's not a prerequisite though.

I'll talk through the current tech stack and suggest other tools you can consider for your use case.

# The tech stack

This site is built with:

- NextJs: Dah
- Contentlayer: this handles rendering my mdx files
- Mantine: The component library

This site is hosted at:

# A note on documentation

Whenever you are getting to grips with a new tool or just want to check how something works then I always recommend reading the official docs.

I have noticed a bit of a silly trend where people basically copy official tutorials onto their personal blogs and change a few words and pass it off as original work. This is annoying and so I wont be doing that.

The official docs for any tool are generally written by people who have the most up to date knowledge of that tool, why it was built, it's shortcomings, it's idioms... Sometimes the official docs do fall short in different ways, maybe something is not explained as well as it could be or your particular use case isn't covered. But the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses.

I'll keep tech documentation as DRY by referring you to the best resources I know of ;)

# Ok, so Next...

If you haven't used Next.js yet - it's a framework built on top of React. [Here is the official tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=homepage-cta&utm_campaign=next-website). It's really worthwhile.

If you just follow along with the official tutorial you will build yourself a blog site that works super well if all you are after is perfectly normal markdown. This is probably enough for most people.

# Getting MDX support

We can do this the easy way or the hard way...

## The easy way

You can follow [this guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx#helpful-links) to get set up. But this approach has some serious downsides.

If you did the official Next tutorial then you would have written an app that allows you to:

- keep all your markdown files in one directory
- make use of perfectly normal YAML frontmatter
- define how your blog post would be rendered and laid out just once instead of all over the place

This is very tidy.

If you follow the guide mentioned above then you will have some problems:

- your MDX files will be nested inside your pages directory. That might not bother you but it irks me a little bit. I do like to have the content separate from the application that renders the content
- you wont be able to use YAML frontmatter out of the box. Apparently you can use plugins to sort this out
- the deal-breaker for me is the fact that the MDX files need boilerplate. If you want a consistent layout then every file will need to import your layout component and set up a default export

It's all just a bit... meh

I can see the benefit in using this approach if you want to have MDX support for your "About Me" page or something like that. But it isn't great for blogging.

## The hard way

Ok, it's not that hard. It's just a bit involved...

You can set things up so that all your MDX files are centrally located outside of your pages directory, and you don't need to write boilerplate code to get everything laid out in the same way.

To do this, we use a tool called Contentlayer.

The [official tutorial](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started) is pretty good over all.

The first thing to know is that, at time of writing, the latest version of contentlayer is not compatible with the latest version of Next.

https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/386

I got it to work by downgrading my next

npm i next@13.0.7

The tutorial also says you should add some lines to tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json. If you don't have that file then just create it.

(TODO: check)

The tutorial says to create a file called. next.config.mjs. You shouldn't need to create it. Rather just edit the file in place. My next implementation started off with a next.config.js file already so I just incorperated the suggested changes. I ended up with

```javascript
const { withContentlayer } = require("next-contentlayer");

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
};

module.exports = withContentlayer(nextConfig);
```

Last up, you need to change things up so you can handle mdx files, not just md files.

Update your contentlayer.config.ts like so:

```javascript
import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from 'contentlayer/source-files'

export const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Post',
  filePathPattern: `**/*.mdx`,   // change this
  contentType: 'mdx',            // and this

  fields: {
    // ... the rest of the file is unchanged
```

Now you'll need to update your post layout. You defined it in `pages/posts/[slug].js`

```javascript
import { useMDXComponent } from "next-contentlayer/hooks";

// a bunch of things stay the same ...

const PostLayout = ({ post }) => {
  const Component = useMDXComponent(post.body.code); // get your mdx component
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>{post.title}</title>
      </Head>
      <article className="mx-auto max-w-2xl py-16">
        <div className="mb-6 text-center">
          <Link href="/">
            <a className="text-center text-sm font-bold uppercase text-blue-700">
              Home
            </a>
          </Link>
        </div>
        <div className="mb-6 text-center">
          <h1 className="mb-1 text-3xl font-bold">{post.title}</h1>
          <time dateTime={post.date} className="text-sm text-slate-600">
            {format(parseISO(post.date), "LLLL d, yyyy")}
          </time>
        </div>
        <Component /> {/* and then use the mdx component */}
      </article>
    </>
  );
};

export default PostLayout;
```

# Mantine

You know how programming languages have different levels of abstractions? Like C is close to the machine, C# is more abstract, and Python even more so? Well, the same thing applies to frontend prettiness.

If you want to style your gui and add some nice widgets and interactions you can either go with pure css (with a sprinkling of js most likely) or you can make use of different tools that abstract away the details. A lot of people like tailwind. Honestly tailwind seems like a wonderful thing. That said, tailwind gives me more control than I want.

So my standard is to reach for a fully fledged component library. There are loads to choose from.

I came across Mantine fairly recently and I've been digging it. So sticking with it :)

The official [getting started guide](https://mantine.dev/pages/getting-started/) is solid.
